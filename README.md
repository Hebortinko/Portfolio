# Portfolio

Personal portfolio ‚Äì tracking my **learning journey** and showcasing skills through practical projects (C++, Java, PHP, SQL‚Ä¶).

This repository serves as my **personal coding portfolio**.  
It‚Äôs both an **archive of my learning process** and a **showcase of practical skills** that I gain step by step while working on projects in different languages.
