# Portfolio
Personal portfolio – tracking my learning journey and showcasing skills through practical projects (C++, Java, PHP, SQL…).

This repository serves as my **personal coding portfolio**.
It's both an **archive of my learning process** and a **showcase of practical skills** that I gain step by step while working on projects in different languages (C++, Java, PHP, SQL..).

## Projects

### C++
- [Transport Simulator]
  A traffic network simulator written in c++. It models roads, intersections, and vehicles, supports route planning, incidents (closures, traffic), and generates reports.
  *(Work in progress - initial setup with Graph structure and demo dataset. JSON loader and routing coming soon.)*
